name: setup-pstack
description: Set pstack up for this user and this computer. Generates the `select-model` skill, which records the agent products and models found here and the user's preferences, so the model running a task can decide which model to use and how. Use for /setup-pstack, "configure pstack models", "pstack budget", or changing pstack's model choices.

# Setup pstack

pstack does not ship a model table. It generates `select-model`, a skill under `~/.agents/skills/select-model/` that holds this user's preferences and this computer's agents and models. Claude Code, Codex, and Grok read it by that path at the start of a task. Nothing loads it for them. The generator can also link it into the skill folders of the products that list skills from their own folder, as the `skills` CLI does, and asks first.

## Steps

### 1. Check what exists

If `~/.agents/skills/select-model/SKILL.md` exists, this is an update. Otherwise it is a new setup. Tell the user which in one sentence.

### 2. Generate or update `select-model`

Run the **create-model-selection-skill** skill by reading its `SKILL.md` next to this one, and follow it to the end. It surveys this computer, asks five questions, writes the skill, and starts one read-only job per agent product to prove it.

### 3. Confirm

Repeat the generator's hand-over in two sentences: where the skill is, and that the next task reads it. Say how to change it: edit a sentence under `## Preferences` in that file, or run `/setup-pstack` again.

When a product on this computer cannot run from this session, say which environment starts it. Orca starts Claude, Codex, and other products as workers. A plain Claude Code or Codex session starts only its own models.

When Grok is among the products, say that Orca starts Grok on the `[models] default` in `~/.grok/config.toml` and refuses model and effort flags, so the model it runs is the one in that file. To change it, edit the file.

### 4. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, run the **create-verification-skill** skill by reading its `SKILL.md` next to this one. On no, move on without pushing.

### 5. Offer a formal verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project already has a formal verification skill (a project skill that runs a model checker, a proof, or another verifier against the code). If not, offer once: "want a formal verification skill, so agents can prove a key property of your code holds in every case in scope, not only the cases tests reach? I can generate one with /create-formal-verification-skill." On yes, run the **create-formal-verification-skill** skill by reading its `SKILL.md` next to this one. On no, move on without pushing.
